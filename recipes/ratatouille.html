    <h3>Traditional Ratatouille</h3>
    <p>Ratatouille is a classic French dish that combines summer vegetablesâ€”usually eggplant, 
        tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and garlic cloves. Ratatouille recipes vary 
        when it comes to the cooking method, though. Some call for roasting the vegetables separately,
        then combining them; others start with a tomato sauce and cook the other ingredients in its liquid. 
        This fairly traditional ratatouille recipe keeps things simple, with whole veggies stewed in a skillet
         on the stovetop in extra virgin olive oil until they are tender and their flavors have blended 
         together beautifully.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, sliced thin</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. eggplant, cut into 1/2" pieces</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini, quartered and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. small ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. dried oregano, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp., dried thyme, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp. ground corianer</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. fennel seeds</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a rat and put it on your head. It doesn't have to be a french rat. I used a New York rat</li>
        <li>Sautee onion and garlic in oil until soft</li>
        <li>Add eggplant, cook for 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in zucchini and bell pepper and cook for 12 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes and seasonings</li>
        <li>ENJOY! (Or not, its up to you)</li>
    </ol>
